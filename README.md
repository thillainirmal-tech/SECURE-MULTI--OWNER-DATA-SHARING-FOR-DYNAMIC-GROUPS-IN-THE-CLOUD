# Secure Multi-Owner Data Sharing for Dynamic Groups in the Cloud

## Project Overview

The project provides a secure, anonymous, and efficient data sharing platform for multiple owners in dynamic groups hosted in the cloud. It leverages group signatures and dynamic broadcast encryption to enable users to securely share data while supporting dynamic group membership changes and efficient user revocation.

---

## Key Features

- Secure multi-owner data sharing in cloud environments.
- Dynamic group management allowing members to join or leave.
- Anonymous data sharing to protect user identities.
- Efficient user revocation without increasing storage or encryption overhead.
- Cryptographic key management for secure encryption and decryption.
- Demonstrated efficiency with rigorous security proofs.

## Technologies Used

- Java (Backend)
- JSP / HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Frontend)
- Apache Ant (Build Automation)
- MySQL (Database)
- NetBeans IDE (Development)
